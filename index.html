           <td>Alan Cohen once wrote, "There is virtue in work and there is virtue in rest. Use both and overlook neither." Sometime's when you do nothing, that's when your best ideas start flowing through your mind. It could be at any point in time. While you're taking a shower, driving, hiking, shopping, watching TV or even talking to your best friend. If your creativity seems to be unavailable at the time, then unplug and let your brain do its magic.</td>

Sometimes the whole experience of writing by hand seeing the ink on our fingers, the smell of a fresh page in a notebook is all it takes to get creative juices flowing.

            <td style="background-color: #abc2e8;"> These colors tend to increase performance on tasks. Researchers say that’s because whene we see blue we think ocean, sky, and openness in general, while green gives out growing vibes. Check out that globe the next time a problem pops up.

So don't throw away those extra boxes you have from amazon. Sit beside it and get those creaive juices flowing.</td>
